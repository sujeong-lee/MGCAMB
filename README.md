Note for DES 
==============
This is a fork of MGCAMB v4 slightly modified to be python-installable. 

To build only, `python setup.py build` \
To build and install, `python setup.py install`, \
which will install `mgcamb` python package in your favorite location. 

To use the package in python, do `import mgcamb`. \
Jupyter notebook for example is in [example.ipynb](https://).\
Cosmosis interface can be found in `cosmosis-standard-library/boltzmann/mgcamb_v4/mgcamb_interface.py` in `extension` branch.


MGCAMB v4.0
===========
## Modified Growth with CAMB
This is the official repository for the MGCAMB v4.0 patch.  Below there are an introduction to the code and the instructions to install and run the code. This new version of the code is introduced in the new paper to be published soon.

## 1. Introduction
Modified Growth with CAMB (MGCAMB) is a patch for the Einstein Boltzmann solver [CAMB](https://github.com/cmbant/CAMB) that intrdouces phenomenological Modifications of Growth (MG) along with dynamical Dark Energy (DE). It includes several phenomenological parametrizations. For instance:

- the mu, gamma parametrization, defined as

</p>

- the mu, Sigma parametrization, defined as
<p align="center">
<img src="img/mu_sigma.png" width="350" title="mu sigma parametrization" />
</p>

- the Q,R parametrization, defined as
<p align="center">
<img src="img/q_r.png" width="350" title="Q R parametrization" />
</p>

MGCAMB is implemented in the latest version of [CosmoMC](https://github.com/cmbant/CosmoMC). The MGCosmoMC code can be found on this [repository](https://github.com/sfu-cosmo/MGCosmoMC)

### Structure of the code
The new MGCAMB patch is structured as in the figure.

<p align="center">
<img src="img/MGCAMB_flowchart.png" width="1000" title="MGCAMB code structure" />
</p>

The parameters in  [``` params_MG.ini ``` ](inifiles/params_MG.ini) are used to run the code and follow the structure above. 
Please, note that dynamical DE is supported in the ``` pure_MG_models ``` and ``` reconstruction model ```, where DE perturbations are also included.

## 2. How to install
To install MGCAMB on your machine, simply run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sfu-cosmo/MGCAMB.git
cd MGCAMB/fortran/
make 
```

## 3. How to run
To run MGCAMB, first modify the  [``` params_MG.ini ``` ](inifiles/params_MG.ini) file according to which models you want to analyze. Then run

```bash
./camb ../inifiles/params.ini
```



## 4. What's new
New features with this new version of the code:
- implemented the QSA models where only dark matter is coupled to scalar field
- implemented reconstruction model for mu, Sigma and Omega_x
- implemented the direct mu, Sigma parametrization for different models
- extended the dynamical dark energy by including the option of having DE perturbations to be consistent with CAMB in GR limit
- provide angular power spectrum of variables for MG models from python interface
  (make sure to use function ``` set_mgparams ``` alongside other functions e.g. ``` set_cosmology ``` or ``` set_params ``` in your script.)
- the code has been restructured and upgraded to CAMB version 1.3.5 

The MG and DE parametrizations along with the computation of the quantities related to the perturbations are introduced in the file [``` mgcamb.f90 ```](fortran/mgcamb.f90).
